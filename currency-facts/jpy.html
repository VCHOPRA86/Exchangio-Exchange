                                        Introduced in 1871, the Japanese yen (Japanese: 円), or JPY, is the official currency of Japan. The symbol of the yen is ¥, along with JP¥, which is sometimes used to separate the Japanese yen from
                                        the Chinese yuan renminbi, which shares the same symbol.

                                        dollar, euro and British pound (GBP) globally.

                                        Japanese yen banknotes are issued by Japan’s central bank, the Bank of Japan, in four denominations: ¥1,000, ¥2,000, ¥5,000 and ¥10,000. Yen coins are issued in six denominations: ¥1, ¥5, ¥10, ¥50,
                                        ¥100 and ¥500.
